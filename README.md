# GitHub Questions Classification

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the development of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for classifying GitHub questions. The goal is to create a model that can automatically categorize GitHub questions into relevant statuses. In this notebook I am using a data from 2012 year (all links in the apropriate section)

## Motivation

GitHub is a widely used platform for collaborative software development, hosting millions of repositories and fostering a vibrant community. With the increasing volume of questions posted on GitHub, it becomes challenging for users to find relevant discussions. This project aims to streamline this process by implementing a machine learning model that can automatically categorize questions based on their content.
